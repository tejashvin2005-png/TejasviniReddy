## 📝 Overview & Motivation
This repository hosts my professional portfolio, designed to showcase my expertise as a highly analytical and results-driven researcher.

My core focus is on **Data Science, Business Analysis, and Technical Development (AI/ML Application and Web Development)**. The projects here demonstrate strong hands-on experience in data pipelining (ETL), statistical analysis, and applying AI/ML techniques to solve complex, real-world problems.

## ✨ Featured Projects & Experience Highlights

* **AI/ML: Object Detection System (OpenCV):** Core application of **Computer Vision (CV)** principles, implemented using the **OpenCV library**.
* **Systems Engineering: Secure Mobile Location Tracker:** Engineered a secure tracking system using **Python** to accurately identify device locations, detect movement, and strictly maintain **strong data security** protocols.
* **Data & Business Analyst Role:** Designed and optimized technical **data pipelines (ETL)** using **SQL and Python**, and produced **executive-level visualization dashboards (Tableau)**.
* **Machine Learning Workflow:** Executed a complete machine learning workflow in WEKA to compare J48 and NaiveBayes Classifiers, achieving 100% accuracy with J48.
